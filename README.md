See the Jupyter (.ipynb) notebook for project description and demonstration, **it should be viewed/executed in Google Colab ([open the notebook](http://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mOTbXkcrulDkOrMAoAnBQ_OV3veESunI)**) for full compatibility since it was created there.

Find my OzML module under /Files for execution.
